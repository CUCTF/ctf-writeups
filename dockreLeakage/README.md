After downloading the docker image provided, you can find part of the flag in 


```bash
  acbb216b17482071caca135101282177f6ffed7b8ee0bfc5323aae103c216d74
```

```bash
"created":"2022-09-03T07:46:12.680399343Z",
         "created_by":"/bin/sh -c echo \"ZmxhZ3tuM3Yzcl9sMzR2M181M241MTcxdjNfMW5mMHJtNDcxMG5fdW5wcjA=\" \u003e /dev/null",
         "empty_layer":true
```
then you can easily decode using base64 it to:

```bash
flag{n3v3r_l34v3_53n5171v3_1nf0rm4710n_unpr0
```

after that, go to this folder

```bash
a67551c4bf4a0beef636c26e22aa4205fececa2a3fe51c906affd158d13fa038
```

and unzip the folder where the flag.txt is to decode to:
```bash
73c73d_w17h1n_7h3_d0ck3rf1l3}
```
